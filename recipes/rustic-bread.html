<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4 oz Organic Cream Cheese</li>
  <li>1/2 cup Organic Whole Full-Fat Ricotta Cheese</li>
  <li>5 Organic Free Range Eggs, room temperature</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons Organic Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
  <li>2 cups Organic Almond Flour, Blanched</li>
  <li>1/4 cup Organic Coconut Flour</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Organic Baking Powder</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons Organic Psyllium Husk Powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon Sea Salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Organic Nutritional Yeast</li>
  <li>Optional Rustic: Caraway Seeds or Italian: Thyme & Oregano</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a baking sheet topped with parchment
    paper.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a large bowl, whisk together room temperature cream cheese and ricotta
    until smooth. Add the room temperature eggs and apple cider vinegar, and
    whisk in well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add all the remaining ingredients and whisk until smooth. The dough will
    still feel sticky at this point. Let rest for 5 minutes for the moisture to
    be absorbed.
  </li>
  <li>
    With wet hands shape the dough into roughly a 4" x 7" loaf. Place on your
    prepared baking sheet and with a small knife, cut 3 diagonal lines on the
    top and with thumbs, pull each line a little bit apart (this will make the
    bread look artisan!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake for 1 hour. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center
    comes out clean. Let cool down completely and enjoy!
  </li>
