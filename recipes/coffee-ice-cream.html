<h3>Rewarding your sacrifice</h3>
<p>
  You've spent the entire week strictly following your personal health regimen.
  You turned and walked away when the pastry, chip and beer sections were
  flirting and calling like sirens.
</p>
<p>
  The struggle to defeat your impulsive desire has its own strengthening
  benefit, and celebrating your display of will by enjoying a bowl of organic
  coffee ice cream can be all that is needed to reset and prepare for another
  week of discipline.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups Organic Half & Half</li>
  <li>1 cup Organic Heavy Cream</li>

  <li>1 teaspoon Organic Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Warm half and half, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat,
    whisking to dissolve sugar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beat egg yolks in a small mixing bowl, add Â½ cup of the warm mixture to the
    egg yolks and whisk to combine. Then add that mixture to the half and half
    on the stovetop.
  </li>
  <li>Whisk in coffee granulates until dissolved.</li>
  <li>
    Cook over medium-low heat stirring constantly until the mixture thickens
    slightly, just barely sticking to the back of a spatula or until it reaches
    170 degrees F.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place the heavy cream into a bowl with a fine mesh strainer on top of the
    bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    Strain the custard into the heavy cream. Discard what is left on the
    strainer.
  </li>
  <li>Add vanilla extract, stir to combine.</li>
  <li>
    Transfer to an airtight container and cool completely in the fridge
    (preferably overnight).
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and churn until frozen (about 30-40
    minutes).
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer to an airtight container and freeze completely, about 4 hours.
