<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb Organic Ground Chicken</li>
  <li>3 Organic Free Range Eggs</li>
  <li>5 oz High Quality Pork Rinds, example 2 EPIC bags</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Grass Fed Ghee or Butter</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon Sea Salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Italian Seasoning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    In your food processor, crush the pork rinds to a fine powder. Set the pork
    rind powder aside.
  </li>
  <li>Melt the ghee on your stovetop.</li>
  <li>
    In your food processor, mix the raw ground chicken, melted ghee, eggs, sea
    salt and Italian seasoning until a smooth paste forms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the pork rind powder to the food processor along with the paste and
    blend. A thick, dense dough will be created.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer the dough on top of parchment paper and place it on a baking sheet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Form the dough into your preferred pizza shape. I made a 12-inch circle with
    mine, then started in the center and pushed the dough outward, thinning out
    the bottom and forming a thick crust. You could also do flatbread pizzas or
    thin crust if you prefer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once you have formed your crust, bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 375
    degrees.
  </li>
  <li>
    Top with pizza toppings (sauce, cheese, cooked meat, etc.) as you would with
    a regular naked crust. Put the crust back in the oven (with the toppings)
    for 10-15 minutes to re-heat the toppings and/or melt the cheese.
  </li>
</ol>
